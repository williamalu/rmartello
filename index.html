			<p>Rob Martello is a Professor of the History of Science and Technology at Olin College, a new school that shares his innovative approach towards engineering education.  Rob has helped design and build the college since its earliest days, and has made significant contributions to Olin’s flexible and technically-integrated Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences (AHS) curriculum; to faculty mentoring and reappointment and promotion guidelines that reconceptualize the traditional research-teaching-service model; and to external outreach and the wider dissemination of best pedagogical practices.  Rob’s teaching gives him the opportunity to creatively pursue his passion… which is to inspire students to develop their own creativity and pursue their own passions.  His interdisciplinary project-based courses include Six Microbes that Changed the World; Science Fiction and Historical Context; Paradigms, Predictions, and Joules; History of Technology Foundation, and The ‘Stuff’ of History.  Some day he will find a way to teach a course on 1980s movies, which will obviously include a significant study of 80s music as well.</p>

		<h1>Historian.</h1>
		<div class="subsection-content">
			<img src="images/book-cover.jpg" alt="Book Cover for Midnight Ride, Industrial Dawn: Paul Revere and the Growth of American Enterprise">
			<p>When he isn’t working with students, Rob loves to shadow Paul Revere’s footsteps and eavesdrop on the conversations in Benjamin Franklin’s print shop.  Rob’s historical research explores the personal narratives and societal roles of America’s earliest designers, makers, and innovators – the colonial and revolutionary-era artisans who figuratively and literally built our nation.  His book, Midnight Ride Industrial Dawn: Paul Revere and the Rise of American Enterprise (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) highlights the “real” Revere, an innovative manufacturer and entrepreneur who helped America break England’s technological stranglehold, while never figuring out how to defy social class barriers and rise into his society’s highest strata.  Rob is currently researching Benjamin Franklin's printing career, investigating Franklin's many impacts upon early American printing as well as the ways his artisan experiences set him apart from America's other founding fathers.  Rob is also the “humanities scholar” for three Mass Humanities grants aimed at developing interactive history of technology exhibits at the Paul Revere House and USS Constitution Museum.</p>

		<h1>Educational researcher.</h1>
		<div class="subsection-content">
			<img src="images/olin-oval.jpg" alt="Picture of the oval in the middle of the Olin College campus.">
			<p>Over the course of a decade of educational research and three National Science Foundation grants, Rob has explored the connections between self-directed project-based learning, interdisciplinary educational approaches, targeted communication-development exercises, and student motivation.  In addition to publishing several papers in IJEE and other journals and offering numerous conference presentations, Rob has delivered over 40 educational workshops for international K-12 and college educators on the topics of interdisciplinary course design; project-based learning; understanding and fostering intrinsic motivation; supporting and scaffolding student autonomy and self-direction; and the integration of sustainability principles into STEM and humanities courses.  This educational research has inspired Rob to continually experiment with his own teaching approach, yielding results that are often enlightening and always exciting. </p>

		<h1>Public speaker.</h1>
		<div class="subsection-content">
			<img src="images/rob-speaking.jpg" alt="Picture of Rob giving a talk at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.">
			<p>Rob loves public speaking and has delivered more than 50 invited talks at educational or scholarly conferences, in academic settings in front of students or teachers, and for public audiences at libraries, historical societies, town halls, and other venues.  Rob has prepared a menu of history talks that introduce his new interpretations of Paul Revere and Benjamin Franklin, highlighting their gripping personal narratives, their artisan identities and aspirations, their progress through colonial and revolutionary-era social classes, and their innovative technical work and contribution to American manufacturing and business.  He also lectures on the subjects of interdisciplinary teaching, intrinsic motivation, and project-based learning, although his lectures frequently practice what he preaches by adopting interactive components in response to specific audience interests.</p>
